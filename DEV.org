* Requirements

  - *Block model*: in, in-event/out ports
  - Meta-data: used to define constraints on blocks, periodicity,
    etc. JSON? or pure lua
  - Ports: in/outs (correspond to in-args and out-args + retval)
  - Composition of blocks.
  - Pure C + Lua. Light, embeddable.
  - Dynamic creation of interfaces: ie. dynamic creation of youbot arms.

Interaction model: defines what happens on read-write to a port,
i.e. buffering, rendevouz, sending via network. See also Ptolomy.

* Elements

** Components:
   define:
   - set of typed in and out ports
   - configuration
   - activity

* Big questions

** Types

  - Types safety must be guaranteed. Hash types in some
    way. I.e. sha256 the struct def?

  - To which extent can we avoid boxing and explicit serialization. I
    think the latter is mandatory for non-trivial structs. We _must_
    also be able to support protocol buffers, boost serialization etc.

   *Options*:

  - Constrain to structs? C++ Objects can be mapped to structs
    (potentially automatically) but that may be non-intuitve. Ok for
    first go.

  - Support full type serialization. Necessary eventually.

  - Requirements
    + types must be *uniquely identified* throughout a (distributed
      system). That can be the name or some hash calculated from the
      struct definition, etc.

    + types must be *registered* with Lua such it knows how to
      interpret these. Probably there will be several classes: 

      1. plain structs (easy using ffi)
      2. protocol buffers
      3. ROS types
      4. luabind
      5. ...


* Future Ideas
** C only definition?

    - How to define type ports, configuration, etc.

** event driven ports

  How to support event-driven ports? when storing data in an event
  port, set owner component as runnable. Or instead offer a trigger
  method that can be implemented by the activity mechanism?  I.e. a
  static schedule will ignore the request, but a thread will be woken
  up?


* Future Ideas

  - Auto-generating fblocks from Linux drivers (or interfaces) maybe
    from sysfs?
